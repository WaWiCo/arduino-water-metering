# Arduino Water Metering 
Arduino-based codes for determining water flow through pipes using a MEMS microphone attached to a pipe. The Arduino version is wireless and communicates with a Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

The Arduino board uses a MEMS microphone to perform acoustic analyses on the piping system. The Arduino board then telemeters the information via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a computer running a Python code ready to receive BLE commands about the acoustic response from the Arduino board.
